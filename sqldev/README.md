# plscope-utils - SQL Developer Extension (plscope-utils for SQL Developer)

## Introduction

plscope-utils simplifies common source code analysis tasks. This SQL Developer extension is based on PL/Scope and provides:

- A `PL/Scope` node in the Connections window.
- A `Compile with PL/Scope` context menu on the Connection and PL/Scope node.
- Detail viewers for tables, views, packages, procedures, functions, triggers, types and synonyms. These viewers are reachable via the appropriate nodes in the Connection window or via `Popup Describe` context menu when positioned on an identifier within a PL/SQL editor.
- A `plscope-utils Reports` folder within the Reports window.

All operations are based on objects available within an Oracle Database Server instance version 11.1 or higher. No database objects need to be installed for this extension. However, the majority of the queries require the `all_statements` view which is available since the Oracle Database version 12.2.

## Examples

### Compile with PL/Scope

Right click on the `Connection` or `PL/Scope` node in the Connection window to show the `Compile with PL/Scope` popup window.

The popup windows provides all relevant options for the Oracle Database version 12.2. However, if you are connected to an older version, just the applicable options are applied.

## Prerequisites

* Oracle Database 11.1 or higher
* Oracle SQL Developer 4.0 or higher

## How to Build

1. [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html) and install SQL Developer 17.2.0
2. [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install Apache Maven 3.5.0
3. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install a git command line client
4. Clone the plscope-utils repository
5. Open a terminal window in the plscope-utils root folder and type

		cd sqldev

6. Run maven build by the following command

		mvn -Dsqldev.basedir=/Applications/SQLDeveloper17.2.0.app/Contents/Resources/sqldeveloper clean package

	Amend the parameter sqldev.basedir to match the path of your SQL Developer installation. This folder is used to reference Oracle jar files which are not available in public Maven repositories
7. The resulting file ```plscope-utils_for_SQLDev_x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.zip``` in the ```target``` directory may be installed within SQL Developer
