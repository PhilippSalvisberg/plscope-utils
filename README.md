# plscope-utils

## Introduction
plscope-utils is based on PL/Scope which is available in the Oracle Database since version 11.1. It consists of the following two components:

- [Core Database Objects](https://github.com/PhilippSalvisberg/plscope-utils/blob/master/database/README.md)

	Provides relational views and PL/SQL packages to simplify common source code analysis tasks. Requires a server side installation.

- [SQL Developer Extension (plscope-utils for SQL Developer)](https://github.com/PhilippSalvisberg/plscope-utils/blob/master/sqldev/README.md)

   Extends SQL Developer by a ```PL/Scope```node in the database navigator tree, context menus, views shown for tables, views and PL/SQL nodes and some reports. Requires a client side installation only.
